Homework 
Submission rules:

• All text answers must be given in Haskell comment underneath the problem
header.

• You must submit a single .hs file with the following name: firstName-

lastName-hw.hs. Failure to do so will result in -10 points.
• You will lose 10 points if you put a module statement at the top of the file. 

• You will lose 10 points for any import statements you have in your file and
will automatically miss any problems you used an imported function on.

• If your file doesn’t compile you will lose 10 points and miss any problems
that were causing the compilation errors.

• This means that any function which is causing compiler errors should be
commented out. There will be no partial credit.

• You must use the skeleton file provided and must not alter any type
signature. If you alter a type signature you will automatically miss that
problem.

• You will lose 10 points if you include a main function in your file.
